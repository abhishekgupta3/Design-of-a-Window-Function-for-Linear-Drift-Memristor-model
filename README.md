# Design of a Window Function for Linear Drift Memristor Model

This repository hosts the implementation code for my research presented at the IEEE Silchar Subsection Conference (SILCON) 2023. The project encompasses MATLAB codes, plots for different window function, and various research paper references.

Feel free to explore the repository and engage with the content for academic or research purposes. Please refer to the accompanying research paper published at IEEE Silchar Subsection Conference (SILCON) 2023 for comprehensive details and the theoretical background of this implementation.
